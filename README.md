Hi, Iâ€™m Sarvesh Chandran (@Sarveshero3)
I am the team leader of Code Eminence, which includes Dewansh Shikhar Singh and Naman Natarajan.
This project is called Project Hostel, which is just a guide or framework to how a hostel management system can be made using Python and can
Be saved in the database. 
Including the chatgpt API which can further help both students and employees to extract data with much more convenience.

Thank you, KR Mangalam and other sponsors for supporting our endeavor.
